     <p> 
         i control the spirit of men with the simplicity of my angelic voice.  
 <br> teeth acute 
 <br> skin overcast, as soft as the fallen feathers from ravens. 
 <br>my hair like silken curls, caressing my shoulders and torso. 
 <br>heart as dark as a starless night. 
<br> with a mouth so divine
<br> and a soul so lonely
<br> i demand to feast on the hearts of shipwrecked men.
 <br>seranading with lullabies 
<br> so sweet and so gentle
 <br>churning the compulsion to spill into 
 <br>the canals of your soul. 
 <br> obey and serve.
